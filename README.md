reCAPTCHA Bypassing with OpenAI Whisper Model

This project demonstrates how to bypass audio-based reCAPTCHA using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion. The solution automates the transcription of the audio challenge using Python.

## Overview

This project leverages Selenium and the OpenAI Whisper model to transcribe audio reCAPTCHA challenges into text automatically. The script navigates through the reCAPTCHA challenge using a web driver and extracts audio, which is then passed to the Whisper model for transcription.

## Features

- **Audio reCAPTCHA extraction**: Extracts the audio challenge file from a web page.
- **Automated transcription**: Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the audio to text.
- **Bypassing reCAPTCHA**: Inputs the transcribed text into the reCAPTCHA field to complete the challenge.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Google Chrome installed
- **Python Packages**:
  - selenium
  - openai-whisper
  - webdriver-manager
  - torch
  - tqdm
